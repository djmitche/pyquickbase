pyquickbase
===========

A Python interface to the `Quickbase API <http://www.quickbase.com/api-guide/whnjs.htm>`_.

This is currently very early-stage, but if it's useful to you, please extend and contribute back.

The basic idea is that ``QuickBaseClient`` handles the API side of things, while ``QuickBaseInterface`` is a loose mapping over the objects (apps, dbs, tables, etc.) in quickbase.
